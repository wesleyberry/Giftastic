# Giftastic

What the project does:
    Giftastic is a webpage that populates a "container" with gifs. Press Any button on the screen and it will populate the bottom div
    with gifs related to the topic. Type a show in the search bar to create a new button.

Why the project is useful
    The project is intended to showcase the usefulness and application of requesting data from a server, and using the response
    to "pick-out" parts of the file. For example, two URLs are extracted in order to animate and stop-animate the gifs.

How users can get started with the project
    Begin by either typing in a new show to the text box and submitting, or by clicking on an existing button.
